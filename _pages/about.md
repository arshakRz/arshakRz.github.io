Hi, I’m Arshak Rezvani. I graduated in Electrical Engineering (Bioelectric track) from Sharif University of Technology. I’m passionate about training neural networks on biomedical data and exploring generative AI, especially diffusion-based models, along with neural ODEs for sampling from complex data distributions.

My recent work spans a variety of exciting research areas, including:

* Generative AI & Diffusion Models
* AI in Healthcare and Biomedical Applications
* Human Feedback–Driven RL (RLHF) and Alignment via Preference Optimization
* Contrastive Learning & CLIP-style Multimodal Pretraining
