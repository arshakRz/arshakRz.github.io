Hi there! I'm Amirabbas Afzali, an undergraduate student in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Mathematics at Sharif University of Technology. Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve developed a strong passion for the theory and practice of machine learning, especially at the intersection of optimization, reinforcement learning, and human-AI alignment.

My recent work spans a variety of exciting research areas, including:

* Trustworthy AI & Adversarial Machine Learning
* Preference Optimization and AI Alignment
* Theory of Optimization and Machine Learning
* Reinforcement Learning, with a focus on Offline RL and Robust RL
